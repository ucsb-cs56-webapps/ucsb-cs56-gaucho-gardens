f18 final remarks 
-We have a few ftl files we did not use as we switched from hard coded plant pages to making vegetables dynamic 
-Recipes are currently string URLs in the Vegetable class, but it might be in reader's interest to create a separate database for recipes and recipes dynamic 
-Figure out how to make the interaction between API keys and JS secured 
-Good luck :)
